  	<h2>Its' role in preventing diseases</h2>

          It is fatal to become inactive within the elderly age, as mentioned they are susceptible to multiple types of diseases, although it doesn’t mean they will obtain the disease; it would mean a higher risk of obtaining it, due to metabolic changes in the body resulting in a less functioning immune system and a slower rate of adapting to environmental adaptation in the body (Kaye, 2011). Depending on how successfully the elderly individual ages, they can become more or less frail, this can be regulated via the way they look after their body - the potential dangers of frailty are that their body mass index can drop which would lead to them becoming more dependent on others and increase the risk of falling and having accidents (Kaye, 2011) - leading to further diseases they can become more vulnerable to as a result of this. This includes coronary heart diseases - which 33% of deaths were attributed to in 2007, and 86% of these came from over 65’s (Mennezes, 2012)- which can be treated with cardiac rehabilitation and improved aerobic exercises (Mennezes, 2012)which lowers the mortality rate, and reduces the chance of the disease becoming fatal. Main illnesses rooted through lack of activeness can also include diabetes, fatigue and falls - all of which can be prevented, within diabetes glucose levels are raised resulting in high blood pressures (Fronzo, 2015)- exercise helps us regulate this and improve glycaemic control; fatigue and falls happen as a result of many things, the latter being that elderly may find it harder to function and perform daily activities, to help regain mobility the adult can perform daily activities slowly (Hawley, 2009) - fatigue can be caused by several things e.g overexertion, under-exercising, medication (Hodes, 2016).
