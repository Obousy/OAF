  	<h2>Importance of Health</h2>
    <tr>
        <th>Physical fitness is arguably the most important factor of life, the reason being is that it allows you to keep active and maintain a healthy weight, as well as promoting strong muscles and bones; it can also prevent diseases such as cardiovascular diseases, type 2 diabetes, heart diseases and various cancers (Haden, 2021). It can also boost mental health, the effects of workouts can be large, some reports even say that it has a similar effect to antidepressants (Schuch, 2016), and breathing exercises and meditation are also known to influence depressive symptoms (Goyal, 2014). Studies show that keeping physically fit can increase the average life expectancy and can boost the quality of life into old age (Langhammer, 2018). It has been also said to improve cognitive function and improve activity throughout the day. And can also improve muscle strength and endurance, which leads to an improvement in the heart and lung’s function, furthermore, can, in turn, improve the efficiency of daily activities. 

Keeping physically fit is increasingly important within the elderly age, as they are more vulnerable to major diseases e.g Parkinson’s, malnutrition; and they can lose muscles mass and their physical functionality is more likely to lower, especially if they are not active - their physical functionality can reflect on their motor function and control (Langhammer, 2018), which decreases with age as a result of structural and chemical changes within the brain as we get older, this, in turn, would decrease the increase the reaction times of general tasks - but can slow down the decrease with physical activity - according to studies, ageing people who are active daily slow down the decay of their motor neurone function by 5% according to physical studies (Buchman, 2006), the motor activities are linked to a variety of health outcomes e.g. mortality, disability. Not only this but the elderly can also improve their cognitive function when they stay more active, which is necessary for a healthy ageing process, cognitive and physical function is interrelated, hence physical activity would reflect on that, studies show that exercise has a significant benefit to the functions of both (Falck, 2019 ) - it has been said when we exercise it can maintain cerebrovascular activity, increases, increases capillary growth and enhances the ability of processing functions in the central nervous system (Radak, 2000), the main reason being is that when we exercise we produce something called glutamate, which is responsible for the increased neurotransmissions to the brain, this allows nerve cells to communicate with other cells more quickly when more are abundant (Liou, 2011). If I can change, you can change, everybody can change (Balboa, 1976). It is a fact that bone density is reduced when you get older, but it is still possible to increase muscles mass and body strength even at the latter’s years of 70-80s (Witchalls, 2020).
