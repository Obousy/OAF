  	<h2>Why it must it is crucial in the latter years</h2>

          The problem however is that the elderly/retired tend to become significantly less active than before and elderly people have significantly weaker strength and physical activeness than compared to a middle-aged person - the crude global prevalence of physical inactivity is 21.4% and most elderly people getting below than the said recommended 150 minutes per week (Langhammer, 2018) - this hence results in bones weakening and muscle mass decreasing within the old age, as well as a lot elderly not only losing activity but are not able to perform daily expected exercises or tasks. One of the reasons being during retirement they become significantly less active than before due to not having many activities to do whilst at home and a lack of passion for extensive work at retirement, this has been a major problem during the pandemic hours as the gyms have been closed down so they have no choice of the gym, and hence have a lack of options in which activities to carry out, but also there may be obstacles which get in there way, as studies show that they are aware of the benefits of the physical activity, 95 percent of elderly people say they understand that physical activities have many benefits (Crombie, 2004), although the same survey shows that 36 percent did no leisure activities and 17 percent did less than 2 hours of exercise a week - however, the reasons being were because of shortness of breath, lack of interest, no access to a vehicle (Crombie, 2004) - hence stating the problem being that the activities presented to them may be far too extensive and they cannot get to an exercise hub easily. This, as mentioned will lead to them eventually becoming physically weak, such as losing their muscle mass or becoming unfit/overweight (Desarkissian, 2020), which will lead to a loss of confidence and an inability to get back in shape because of low motivation and not an adequate level of energy and fitness to get back their strength. However, one of the main problems discovered is that the solutions for the elderly are not of a satisfactory level to improve poor conditions of health, rather something that is tailored to their abilities is a better solution, which can slowly optimise their health. 

          To combat low health, the average elderly individual must get at least 150 minutes of exercise would be beneficial, which is the expected average (Langhammer, 2018) for their age group, as it leads to longevity of their life according to studies (Almeida, 2021) - this is a potential way of slowly building their activeness, and improving their mental wellbeing and ageing process, such as a jog every alternate day or picking up small weights and slowly building. However, their workouts must differ based on what they need, for example, someone suffering from muscle loss must build their muscles through picking up weights and regular activities that train their muscles, whereas someone who suffers fatigue and tiredness must get more cardio training and fitness to challenge themselves. Cardiac rehabilitation has been known to reduce mortality rates and can improve the fitness of the elderly person (Mennezes, 2012) and other exercise therapy classes and yoga can be attended to improve health. At home, there remains a lack of options within the exercise field, although organic exercises can be attempted and online videos can be shown, which can be used as leverage for exercise therapy - simple exercises can be used for support.
